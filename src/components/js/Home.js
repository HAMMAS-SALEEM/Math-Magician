        They are among the simpler interactive software tools, and, as such,
        they provide operations for the user to select one at a time. They
        can be used to perform any process that consists of a sequence of
        steps each of which applies one of these operations, and have no
        purpose other than these processes, because the operations are the
        sole, or at least the primary, features of the calculator, rather
        than being secondary features that support other functionality that
        is not normally known simply as calculation.
        As a calculator, rather than a computer, they
        usually have a small set of relatively simple
        operations, perform short processes that are not compute intensive
        and do not accept large amounts of input data or produce many results.
